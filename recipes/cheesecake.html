    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 Oreo cookies regular</li>
        <li>18 Oreo cookies crumbled</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
        <li>24 ounces of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup of sour cream or plain full-fat yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Whipped cream for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the crust:</strong> Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Place a 9-inch springform in the center of a large sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil (about 18 by 18-inches). Carefully wrap foil around sides of cheesecake pan, spray inside with non-stick spray.</li>
        <li>In a food processor or blender, pulse 20 Oreos to fine crumbs. In a medium mixing bowl stir together the Oreo crumbs and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Press mixture into an even layer in bottom of prepared springform pan. Bake in preheated oven 9 - 10 minutes then allow to cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>For the filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add in the sour cream or yogurt and the vanilla and mix well. Add eggs one at a time and mix on low speed just until combined.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in 13 crumbled Oreo cookies. Do not over-mix. Pour the filling into the cooled crust.</li>
        <li>Place the springform pan into a large roasting pan and place in the oven. Fill the roasting pan up with hot water until the water level comes about halfway up the outside of the cheesecake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven 50 - 60 minutes, or until the center is almost set. Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Let the cheesecake rest in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Loosen the cheesecake from the rim of the pan and remove the rim. Top with whipped cream, crumble remaining 5 Oreos and sprinkle over cheesecake. Cut into slices and serve chilled.</li>
        <li>Cover the cheesecake and store in refrigerator up to 4 days.</li>
    </ol>
